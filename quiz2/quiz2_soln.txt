1.1 Three possible features of a web application that require a server-side component are databases, authentication, and dynamic pages.
Server-side components are usually written in PHP or Python and allow for faster load times. The way they work is that dynamic HTML pages are generated by running a script directly on the web server after a request is made by the user. PHP is able to connect to the database using the MySQLi extension and PDO (php data objects). If a website were to be storing information in a database, they would use a server-side component in their application. A lot of applications require authentication, which occurs through the serverside component. Dynamic pages that are written in HTML also require a server-side component because the script is run directly on the web server after a request has been made, after which HTML code is sent directly to the client browser in the form of a web page.


1.2. Two actions that can be taken to secure a web application are implementing SSL/TLS encryption and creating a maximum script execution time to define how long a particular script can run on the server. The SSL/TLS encryption encrypts all the data that occurs in transit through the secure HTTPS protocol. Utilizing SSL can seriously be used well to secure a web application. A maximum script execution time simply ensures that the time allotted to run a script on the server. Shortening this time would narrow the time possibilities for attackers to attack the main page.
